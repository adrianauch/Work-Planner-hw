# Work-Planner-hw

##

The web application was created for a user to be able to use and a daily planner with hourly blocks to write in notes/scheduled items. The planner has the current date and the hour sections are color coded to represent the current hour (red), upcoming hours (green) and past hours are greyed out, to help users visually as the day goes on. The data is stored in local storage so the user can exit out of the application and re-open it later with out losing their notes/schedule. The main problem the pallner solves is to provide the user with a basic simple way to keep track of events throughout their day. I learned how to take pre-existing code and make it interactive for users. I also finally figured out how to use local storage and store variables where users can access them later. Additionally, using momnet made displaying time and dates so easy and will be a great tool to use in the future.

A browswer is all that is required to use this application.
